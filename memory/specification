The following is a simple "Hello World" console application code written in C#.

```C#
using System;

namespace HelloWorld
{
    class Program
    {
        static void Main(string[] args)
        {
            Console.WriteLine("Hello World!");
            Console.ReadKey();
        }
    }
}
```

Here's the breakdown:
1. `using System;` - This is a using directive that brings the System namespace into scope. The System namespace contains fundamental classes and base classes, such as Console.
2. `namespace HelloWorld { ... }` - This defines a namespace, which organizes your code into discrete, logical units.
3. `class Program { ... }` - This defines a class, which is an object-oriented construct. This class contains the data and method definitions that your program will use when it's executing.
4. `static void Main(string[] args){ ... }` - This is the entry point of any c# console app. When the application is started, Main is the first method that gets called.
5. `Console.WriteLine("Hello World!")` - This prints the string "Hello World!" to the console screen.
6. `Console.ReadKey();`  - This waits for a key press, and prevents the console window from closing immediately, so we're able to read the output.
