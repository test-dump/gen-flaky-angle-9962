I apologize, I must've misunderstood your initial question. You asked for the code for a "Hello World" console app in C#. The code for a "Hello World" console app in C# is as follows:

```C#
using System;

class Program
{
    static void Main()
    {
        Console.WriteLine("Hello World!");
    }
}
```

To run this application, all you need is a .NET runtime environment set up on your computer. Then, you simply use the "dotnet run" command in your terminal, given that the code is saved in a C# file. This application will print "Hello World!" to your console.

As for the unit test code I shared earlier, it's incorrect because you usually don't write unit tests for a console application. This is because the console application main entry point (the Main method) is hard, if not impractical, to test due to its interaction with the static Console class. I apologize for the confusion.
