The System namespace contains fundamental classes and base classes, such as Console.\n2. `namespace HelloWorld { ... }` - This defines a namespace, which organizes your code into discrete, logical units.\n3. `class Program { ... }` - This defines a class, which is an object-oriented construct. This class contains the data and method definitions that your program will use when it's executing.\n4. `static void Main(string[] args){ ... }` - This is the entry point of any c# console app. When the application is started, Main is the first method that gets called.\n5. `Console.WriteLine(\"Hello World!\")` - This prints the string \"Hello World!\" to the console screen.\n6. `Console.ReadKey();`  - This waits for a key press, and prevents the console window from closing immediately, so we're able to read the output."}]
